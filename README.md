## Description

Group your daily tasks into the four quadrants and prioritize them:

* Important and Urgent - Do it now
* Important but Non-Urgent - Schedule it for later
* Unimportant but Urgent - Delegate it
* Unimportant and Non-Urgent - Eliminate it

When you have many tasks that need prioritization, it's key to complete the ones that really matter.

This model is perfect to make day-to-day decisions.

## Goals of this small project

Learning the basics of Vue, Vuex, Vue Router, and Tailwind CSS.

I've used MirageJs to simulate API responses. It also has a simple in-memory database where I define Models of the data and their Relationships.

In addition, I've built a simple login/register/logout functionality. (But there is no encryption of the information.)

When you reload the browser, if you have registered an user, it will be deleted because MirageJs resets its state.

Also, I've used Vue-ChartJs to create a simple bar chart.
